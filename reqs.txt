- Given a specific article URL from a website, return the title and content of the article to the user.
- We suggest using a HTTP library like Requests to get the raw HTML file of the URL. 
-- Then use a parsing library like Beautiful Soup to parse the content. 
-- Alternatively, you can also use a Python scraping tool like Scrapy.

OTHER STUFF TO DO:

- Add unit tests
- Test this out by outputting a lot of articles to a spreadsheet and QAing the data. See what logic we're missing. Would need a way to get available article URLs
- Run as a scheduled job
